# Image Classification using Pooling

Project is about designing a Trained Neural network  to classify an Image I/P using deep-learning concept

There are many Layers(Sliding Window Convolution, ReLU Activation, Max Pooling, Flattening, Fully Connected etc) which decides the class of our Input  Image.
